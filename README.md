The project utilized Python to collect and preprocess user interaction data from Platform X, which was stored in MongoDB for efficient handling of unstructured data. Data cleaning and transformation were performed to prepare the dataset for modeling. A machine learning model was then developed to predict user behavior patterns based on engagement metrics. Finally, an interactive dashboard was designed and deployed with Streamlit, enabling real-time visualization and exploration of prediction results.
